# Next Steps

- add warning, that logs contain every key in plain-text. Passwords, too!
- Create combos which do not use capslock. Pure home-row.
- sub-command "list" to list available devices
- sub-command "combo" should be able to man-in-the-middle several devices. Several cli args
- --debug for `combos` should not be needed. This should always get created.
