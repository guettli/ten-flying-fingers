# Ten Flying Fingers

I learned [touch typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) several years ago. And I can write blind almost everything. 

But some key are not easy to reach. For example these keys: Pos1, End or Del

I want to keep the pointing fingers on "F" and "J" as much as possible.

# Keys which are hard to access

These keys are hard to access if you want to keep the pointing fingers on "F" and "J"

- Pos1, End
- CursorUp, CursorDown, CursorLeft, CursorRight
- PageUp, PageDown
- Backspace
- Del
- Esc
- ...

# Example: Choose item from auto-complete list

Imagine the active cursor is in the address bar of your browser.

You enter some characters to get to a page you visted yesterday.

It appears on the drop-down box.

Up to now you could keep your fingers on "F" and "J".

But now? How to choose the item from the list, without using the mouse?

Arrow-down is not easy to reach.

I use CapsLock-n for that now.

# I am happy with most other keys on the keyboard

I know that there are alternative keyboard layouts like neo2 or colemark. But I am happy with the default QWERTY or QWERTZ layout. 

I want to improve the default layout, I don't want to replace it. I want to be able to use the keyboard of my team mates and family members like I am used to.

# KMonad

I use [KMonad](The Onion of Keyboard Management Tools, available on GNU/Linux, Windows, and MacOS) for that now.

You can see my config in [remapping-keys.kmonad](./remapping-keys.kmonad).

# Trackpoint with Sandpaper

I want to keep my fingers close to the home row for moving the mouse cursor.

That's why I use a keyboard with Trackpoint.

There are the well-known Lenovo keyboards, but there are alternatives like [Tex Shinobi](https://tex.com.tw/products/shinobi).

To get maximum grip, I stick sandpaper on the trackpoint.

Caution: Don't stick sandpaper on the trackpoint of your laptop. If you close the laptop, then it is likely that
the sandpaper will scratch the screen.
