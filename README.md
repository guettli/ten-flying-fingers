# History
I used Emacs for more then 15 years. Mostly for programming Python. In 2015 I switched from Emacs to PyCharm. In Emacs it is easy to go to the beginning/end of a line. During configuring PyCharm I asked myself: Why not configure this once? Why configure every single application?

Other example: In thunderbird many users configure a shortcut to delete mails. The del-key works, but users configure a short cut. Why? Because "del" is hard to access....

# I am happy with most other keys on the keyboard

I know that there are alternative keyboard layouts like neo2 or colemark. I am happy with the default QWERTY or QWERTZ layout. I want to improve QWERTY, I don't want to replace it. I want to be able to use the keyboard of my team mates and family members like I am used to.

# Why not xmodmap ...

The basics could be solved by using xmodmap. But later I would love to have a command line interface which does much more then just mapping one keyboard key to an other key.

# Copy+Paste with same shortcuts everywhere
I want the same shortcut for copy+paste in all applications. I choose to take the common ctrl-c ctrl-v for this. Works every where except the x/gnome terminal.

This is easy to solve. Just use Edit -> Keyboard of the gnome terminal: http://askubuntu.com/questions/53688/making-ctrlc-copy-text-in-gnome-terminal
